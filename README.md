## Hi, I'm Daniel

I'm currently an incoming junior at the University of Chicago studying Mathematics and Computer Science. Specifically, I am interested in interested in partial differential equations, numerical analysis/applied math, and probability. At UChicago, I'm involved in Paragon National Group, Maroon Capital, and Algo Group. I'm a music enthusiast and a fan of social deduction games, like [Coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_(card_game)), [Spyfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyfall_(card_game)), [Codenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)), and [Avalon](https://avalon.fun/).

## Personal Projects
#### Trader Titans - [tradertitans.netlify.app](https://tradertitans.netlify.app/)
Developed a web-based multiplayer game that involves trading and market making concepts using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Socket.IO for client/server connection. Used by finance clubs at UChicago to practice trading and risk assessment in a competitive (but friendly) environment.
#### diary.vim - [1rv/vim-diary](https://github.com/1rv/vim-diary)
Updated a deprecated [timer plugin](https://github.com/mkropat/vim-tt) and changed it to support my specific needs, and implemented a task-tracking diary as a plugin to Vim and Neovim. Includes a customizable timer that defaults to a basic pomodor timer.
#### LaTeX Shortcut Suite - [1rv/nvim-config](https://github.com/1rv/nvim-config)
Implemented an optimized library of shortcuts, templates, and environment sensitive macros using [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip), updated to the latest math classes that I take. Currently includes shortcuts for calculus, real analysis, measure theory, differential equations, abstract algebra, complex analysis, and linear algebra.
